# React Native Boilerplate with Redux (Expo)
Basic react native app that integrated with redux. I created this repo to use this template in my projects.
But if you want to use it this are the steps you should follow:

1. Clone this repository ( git clone https://github.com/mhmt/react-native-redux-template.git )
2. Install the dependencies ( npm install )
3. Change the project name in package.json and app.json
4. Install expo-cli if you dont have installed. ( npm i -g expo-cli )
5. Start the project with "expo start"
